<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>While virtual reality holds great promise for enhancing STEM education, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with its use. One risk is the possibility of experiencing side effects such as motion sickness, eye strain, or disorientation, which can impact students' comfort and focus during VR experiences. Another concern is the high cost of VR equipment and software, which may limit its accessibility in schools with limited resources.
