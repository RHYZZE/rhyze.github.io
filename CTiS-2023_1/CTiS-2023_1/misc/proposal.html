		<td> <em>We chose this because computers have become an integral part of education and learning. With the increasing demand for digital literacy and the rise of online learning, the use of computers in education has become more important than ever. Virtual reality technology offers unique and interactive learning experiences that have been shown to enhance student engagement. The benefits of using VR virtual reality can create a safe environment for students to explore and experiment without fear of consequences, providing them with hands-on learning opportunities that they may not have otherwise. Virtual Reality can be used for simulations of scientific experiments and studies that could have dangerous or expensive resources that will be easily accessible using VR.
