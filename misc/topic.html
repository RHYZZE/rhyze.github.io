<h1>Virtual reality enhancing high school students' engagement</h1>


</ul><h5>Our project focuses on the potential of virtual reality technology to transform high school in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education by creating engaging and interactive learning experiences. We aim to investigate the new possibilities for immersive and effective learning.<p><p></h5>

<p>We chose this because it presents incredible opportunities for society. One of the key advantages is creating a safe environment for students to learn and explore without fear of consequences. With virtual reality, students can engage in hands-on learning experiences that would otherwise be challenging or impossible. It opens up a world of easily accessible resources and simulations, making everything readily available at students' fingertips. </p>
