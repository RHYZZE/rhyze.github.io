<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

<h2>Choices available when adopting VR in STEM:</h2>


</ul><h4><p>Firstly, educators need to evaluate the range and quality of STEM-focused VR content and applications. Not all VR experiences are equally effective for teaching STEM concepts,<br> so it is crucial to select those that align with curriculum goals and offer meaningful learning experiences. Secondly, considering the compatibility of VR systems is vital. Different<br> VR devices may have varying technical specifications and software requirements, which need to be assessed to ensure seamless integration with existing STEM resources and infrastructure.<br> By critically assessing these choices, educators can make informed decisions to maximize the benefits of VR technology in enhancing STEM education.
